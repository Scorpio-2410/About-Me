- 👋 Hi, I’m Nabidul :).
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, listening to music, sports, cars, and anything cool and fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DSA and trying to practice it Leetcode actively. I am trying to learn how to become a "programmer", doing side projects in various languages.
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate with people of all programming experience and learn or build projects together.
- 📫 You can reach me via Discord: Scorpio8084 or Instagram: _nabidul.24_.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact that I googled: "That Windows desktop's "Refresh" button is not some magical tool which keeps your computer healthy."
