- 👋 Hi, I’m Nabidul :).
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, listening to music, sports, cars, and anything cool and fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DSA and trying to practice it on Leetcode actively and attempting to become a "programmer", by doing side projects in various languages. I am also currently studying software engineering at the University of Technology Sydney and commencing my 3rd year of study in 2024.
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate with people of all programming experience and learn or build projects together.
- 📫 You can reach me via Discord: Scorpio8084, Instagram: _nabidul.24_ & Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nabidul-islam-1228b1223/.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact that I googled: "That Windows desktop's "Refresh" button is not some magical tool which keeps your computer healthy."
